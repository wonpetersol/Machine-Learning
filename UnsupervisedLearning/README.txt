#WHY?
Time to explore unsupervised learning algorithms. This part asks you to use some of the clustering and dimensionality reduction algorithms we've looked at in class and to revisit earlier assignments. The goal is for you to think about how these algorithms are the same as, different from, and interact with your earlier work.

The same ground rules apply for programming languages and libraries.

#PROBLEMS
You are to implement six algorithms. The first two are clustering algorithms:
k-means clustering
Expectation Maximization

The last four algorithms are dimensionality reduction algorithms:
PCA
ICA
Randomized Projections
Any other feature selection algorithm

#HOW?
Instructions on running the code (all the codes are written in jupyter notebook)
- Open anaconda navigator (anaconda 3) and select 'Launch' unnder Jupyter Notebook
- Navigate to the folder downnloaded - CS7641 Unsupervised Learning - 
	Dataset 1 - open 'UnsupervisedLearning_Dataset1.ipynb'
	Dataset 2 - open 'UnsupervisedLearning_Dataset2.ipynb'
	(there should be 2 .ipynb files and 2 .csv files)
- Run it!
